    - `coin`: The coin to withdraw, e.g. `USDT`.
    - `amount`: The amount to withdraw.
    - `address`: The address to withdraw to.
    - `network`: The network to withdraw to, e.g. `TRX`. You can retrieve the network from the `deposit_addresses` endpoint, using the `netWork` field.
    - `contract_address`: The contract address to withdraw to. You can use it to make sure it's the token you expect.
    - `memo`: The memo to withdraw to. Only needed for some networks.
    - `remark`: Text to add to the withdrawal record.
    - `timestamp`: The timestamp for the request, in milliseconds (default: now).
    - `validate`: Whether to validate the response against the expected schema (default: True).
